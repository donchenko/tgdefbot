Welcome to WordDefinerBot! ðŸ“šðŸ¤–

I'm here to help you expand your English vocabulary. Here's what I can do:

- Provide definitions for any English word
- Save words to your personal dictionary
- Display your saved words
- Let you hear word pronunciations

To get started, simply type any English word to see its definition. After viewing a definition, you'll see a button to add the word to your dictionary.

You can access your saved words anytime through the "Dictionary" button, which will appear after adding a word.

Each word in your dictionary comes with options to see its definition again or remove it from your list.

We're constantly working on expanding the bot's functionality to enhance your learning experience!

Let's begin exploring new words together! ðŸš€
